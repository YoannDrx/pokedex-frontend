#  📚 Pokedex

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

The goal of this challenge is to get familiar with the PokeAPI webservice (**[https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/)**).

Your task is to create a website that can display the list of all the Pokémon returned by the webservice.

Upon loading the page, the first 15 Pokémon should be displayed after the "Pikachu" card, which will serve as your reference. Then, every time the "next" button is clicked, the following 15 Pokémon should be displayed after the previous ones.

Make sure to follow the NextJS style rules, including replacing all classic selectors with classNames.

- Apply React concepts: divide the application into different components, set up states to manage the display of the list, etc.
- The management of states and the loop of requests to PokeAPI is the most complex step, and we recommend that you use async/await mode for fetching: **[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)**

This challenge is suitable for beginner developers who want to improve their skills with NextJS and React. Feel free to fork this project and start coding!
